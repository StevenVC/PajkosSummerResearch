Coding Best Practices:
•	Read the article on commenting code at the link below
•	Record your top three tips for code commenting
•	In your coding activity, make sure to follow these guidelines moving forward, according to your 3 tips (or more if you want)

Coding Activity:
•	Download the 2 data files (AKA .dat files) from our supernova outputs (google drive below)
•	Plot the "neutron star mass" vs time for both simulations (units are in grams and seconds) (info contained in the header)
o	For the s12 file, subtract 0.184469701 from the time values
o	For the s40 file, subtract 0.366373606 from the time values
o	Convert the y axis into units of solar masses
•	Plot the "correct PNS radius" vs time for both simulations (units are in centimeters and seconds)
o	Convert the y axis into units of solar radii
•	Using a function you create (that takes radius and time as inputs), create an array that contains the derivative of the "correct PNS radius" with respect to time.
o	Plot the derivative of the "correct PNS radius" vs time
•	Explore the .dat files.  Using any columns, create any plot type you would like
•	Upload your notebook (not the .dat files) to github when complete

Supernovae:
•	Read paragraphs 3 and 4 of the thesis link below (from "core collapse supernovae occur..." to "...the star explodes"
•	These are two very dense paragraphs of scientific literature, so don't worry about understanding every line.  In a text file dedicated to astrophysics terms (this will be your 'astrophysics dictionary' moving forward), write down the words/terms you do not know.  Feel free to google a few of the terms and we will review the remaining ones together. Upload your astro-dictionary when complete.

Gravitational Waves:
•	Watch the video called "The Invisible Colors of the Universe" at the link below.
•	Record any questions that may arise about gravitational waves

Miscellaneous:
•	Attached is advice written from another undergrad researcher named Sheldon, who's been involved with our research group for a couple years now.
