>Magnetic fields seem to create jets of magnetized material/plasma that is accelerated outward from the star or supernova
	in highly asymetric ways.
>These jets seems to be able to affect the formation and structure of the SN shock front
>The rapid rotation of some massive stars after they collapse may further amplify the magnetic fields surrounding the star

>Differential Rotation: Different regions of a spinning object stay in the same position relative to one another
>Dynamo Action: Mechanism by which the magnetic field of a celestial body is maintained

>Assuming a magnetic bar with a strength of 100 G and a magnetic field strength of CCSNe of 10^(15) as stated in the paper
	We expect CCSNe magnetic fields to be around 10^(13) times stronger.
