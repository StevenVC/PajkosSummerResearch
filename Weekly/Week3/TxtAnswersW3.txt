Neutrino Emission from Supernovae: https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08713
Electron capture - Process to stabalize an atom. Inner shell electron combines with proton, forms a neutron and 
	electron neutrino

Neutrinos - 0 net charge, low rest mass, low interaction chance. Interacts primarily via the weak interaction and gravity

Electron Neutrino - 

Antineutrinos - Equal value but opposite sign properties. One exists for each neutrino.



Supernova Neutrinos: https://neutrinos.fnal.gov/sources/supernova-neutrinos/
99% of a supernova's energy is dispersed as a busrt of neutrinos 
	
Scientists caught neutrinos from a supernova in a nearby galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud ?
	How can they be sure?
