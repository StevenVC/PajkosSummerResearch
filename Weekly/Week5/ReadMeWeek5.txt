Supernovae: ( https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/educators/lessons/xray_spectra/background-elements.html )
  ChemEnrichment:
    -CCSNe are responsible for the synthesis of elements heavier than iron.
    -Supernovae are the primary engine by which the ISM is enriched
    -As the universe evolves and heavier elements are formed newly formed stars are affected by the increase in heavier elements
  
  Chaos and Structure:
    -The shockwaves created by SN shape and affect other structures within the ISM
      -Causing cloud collapse which can form new stars
    -CCSNe/SN are not spherically symetric

  -Theory, Observation, and Computation relate by means of supporting and furthering eachother
    -Observation can be done to gather data to be used in computations which can be used to test theory for example
  -Computational studies helps bridge theory and observations by simulating natural phenomena with numerical methods

  -{h+ , hx} 
    -As presented in the paper Q (Quadruple Moment?) is based in spherical coordinantes

    -Areas of high density GW? 
      -Caused by orientation relative to the rotating objects? At the poles it would be high due to D/C interference
