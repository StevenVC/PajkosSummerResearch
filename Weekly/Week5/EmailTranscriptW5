Coding Best Practices:
•	Read up on jupyter notebook shortcuts and find a few you'd like to use in the future

Coding Activity:

Activity in Animation
•	Find a source that walks through animations when using matplotlib
o	Try googling 'animation matplotlib', 'animation pyplot', 'animation jupyter', etc...
o	(I used this one, feel free to google others that work for you) https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/animation/animation_demo.html#sphx-glr-gallery-animation-animation-demo-py
•	In a single panel plot, starting at t = 0 and ending at t = 10, animate the evolving line: h(t) = cos(t)
•	Define a new time dependent term: r(t) = h(t)(1 + cos(theta)), where theta = [0, 2pi]
•	In a single plot, starting at t = 0 and ending at t = 10, animate the evolving "strain surface plot" produced by r(t) (what we created at the end of our meeting today)
•	In a 2 panel subplot, animate h vs t in the left panel, and the strain surface plot for r(t) in the right panel, simultaneously
o	Be sure to include the time as text somewhere on the strain surface plot
Putting it all together
•	Generalize this 2 panel animation to the real strain h(t) you've calculated for s12 and s40

Supernovae:
•	Read this article on chemical enrichment due to supernovae
•	https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/educators/lessons/xray_spectra/background-elements.html
•	Which elements are flung into space from CCSNe?
•	Based on the pictures, are CCSNe spherically symmetric processes?
 
Gravitational Waves:
•	Read the first 2 paragraphs of the introduction in this paper
•	https://academic.oup.com/ptps/article/doi/10.1143/PTPS.128.183/1930275
•	In your own words, how do theory, observation, and computation (what we do) relate?
•	Find the equations for h+ and hx; how do they depend on angle?
•	Watch the video below that visualizes the GW emission from BHs (this will be similar to our end goal, but with CCSNe)
•	https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01153-7
