Coding Best Practices:
•	Take a look at different python tricks and record 2 you'd like to use in the future
		-Use oneline for loops
		-Use multiple assignment

Supernovae:
•	Read up on the r process (the nuclear physics section and astrophysical sights)
		-It is a set of nuclear reactions that are responsible for creating a large amount of heavy elements (heavier than iron)
		-It is a series of rapid neutron captures by one or more heavy seed nuclei (typically iron?)
			-Rapid in tht they occur before radioactive decay has yet to occur
		-?This sequence can continue up to the limit of stability of the increasingly neutron-rich nuclei (the neutron drip line) to physically retain neutrons as governed by the short range nuclear force?
		-Occurs in regions where there is a high density of free neutrons
		-
•	What is the r process?  Where does it take place?
		-Nuclerar Physics 
			-Can take place in low mass supernocae, Type 2 supernovae, and neutron star mergers
		-Astrophysical 
			-Most likely location core-collapse supernovae 
			-Because of these spectroscopic features it has been argued that such nucleosynthesis in the Milky Way has been primarily ejecta from neutron-star mergers rather than from supernovae
			-
•	What is photodissociation?  beta minus decay?
		-Photodissociation: The decomposition of compunds caused by photons/light
		-Beta Minus Decay: A type of radioactive decay where a beta particle (electron or positron) are emitted from an atomic nucleus
			-this causes the nuclide to change to a isobar 
				-Either neutron to proton (release electron and antineutrino)
				-Or proton to neutron (release of a positron with a neutrino)
•	Record any unknown phrases in your astro dictionary

Gravitational Waves:
•	Read this webpage on detecting GWs & watch the video (be careful the audio is unusually loud)
•	What is an interferometer?
		-Its a device used to measure the interfecene patterns created by two or more light sources.
		-These interference patterns can have incoded information about various phenomena such as gravitational waves
•	If GWs pass through matter, why can we measure them?
		-The pass through matter but they also coause space to stretch meaning this matter is stretching/contracting
		-This allows us to measure them with setups like interferometers
