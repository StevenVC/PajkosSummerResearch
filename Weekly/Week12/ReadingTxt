-Reshape
	-Follows the name, gives an existing array a new shape
	-Allows for dimensional reduction of arrays
	

-allclose
	-Checks if two arrays (elementwise) are approximatley equivalent according to a tollerance value
	-Returns boolean values

-where
	-Returns the index position of elements in an array that satisfies specified conditions
	-This function can also replace values of an array depending on how thet meet a condition

-clip
	-In essence this function changes the values of an array to stay within a specified range
	-Can be used to modify an array and assign it to a new array

-einsum
	-Einstein summation convention
	-Multipurpse function that can operate faster an more efficently than some other array functions
	-Can replicate functions such as np.diag, np.transpose, matrix multiplication,
		vector multiplication


Kilonova:
-Occurs in compact binary systems when two compact objects merge into eachother
-Believed to emit short gamma-ray bursts and strong EM radiation due to the radioactive 
	decay of heavy r-process nuclei during the merger event
-The duration of the observed light curve can in part be attributed to the emission of
	EM radiation (gamma-ray photon) during neutron capture. 
-short gamma-ray bursts (?)
